    "# Finding your instagram unfollowers: \n",
    "\n",
    "Hi! I'm devin. i hate people who unfollow their friends on instagram to make their profile seem \"cooler\". so i've built a quick script that helps you identify who these people are so that you can call them out, and/or unfollow them back!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Requesting Instagram Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Instagram makes it relatively easy to download your data. Please follow the following steps to download your data. \n",
    "1. Go to your instagram accounts center: <a href=\"https://accountscenter.instagram.com/?entry_point=app_settings\">https://accountscenter.instagram.com/?entry_point=app_settings</a>. (instagram.com -> settings -> accounts center)\n",
    "2. Next go to \"Your information and permissions\" --> \"Download your information\" --> \"Download or transfer information\". \n",
    "3. Select your account (instagram), then select \"Some of your information\". Scroll down and select \"Followers and following\" from \"Connections\". Then hit next and \"Download to device\".\n",
    "4. Make sure it downloads Date range: \"All time\", and format: \"HTML\". Any media quality should be fine, given we're not downloading any media. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Downloading Instagram Data\n",
    "1. Once you've recieved an email saying, download your data, download your data via Instagram's instructions. Open the zip and make sure you can find the instagram data folder. \n",
    "2. Next, we're going to setup your python environment. Do the following: \n",
    "- Use VScode or your favorite IDE to make a folder. In the folder, copy this notebook, and two files from your instagram data: \"followers_1.html\" and \"following.html\", located inside the connections parent folder. \n",
    "3. Now you're ready! \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the notebook and try to make sure everything works! If you have any problems or challenges, feel free to reach out to me! \n",
